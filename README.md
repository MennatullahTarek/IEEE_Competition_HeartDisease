## üîç Approach

We employed **Fine-Tuning** techniques to improve the performance of our machine learning models. Fine-tuning involves optimizing hyperparameters of the models, rather than using a fixed configuration like random forests. The primary goal is to fine-tune the model's performance by adjusting its parameters, using techniques such as Grid Search, Random Search, or advanced optimization algorithms like Bayesian Optimization.

### Fine-Tuning Process:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** 
   - Handle missing values using imputation.
   - Normalize/standardize features where necessary.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   
2. **Model Selection:**
   - Experiment with different classifiers such as **XGBoost** and **Logistic Regression**.
   
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Use **GridSearchCV** and **RandomizedSearchCV** for finding the optimal hyperparameters.
   
4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate models using **cross-validation** and performance metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1 score**.
   
5. **Model Deployment (Optional):**
   - Use **Flask** or **FastAPI** to deploy the model for making real-time predictions.

## üí° Key Insights:
- The analysis and model fine-tuning allowed us to achieve high accuracy in predicting heart disease.
- Key features influencing predictions include **BMI**, **PhysicalHealth**, and **Age_Category**.
- Continuous validation and model updates are crucial to maintain model performance as new data becomes available.

## üöÄ Next Steps
- Further fine-tuning the model by using **deep learning techniques** such as neural networks.
- Extend the dataset by collecting more medical records to increase the model's reliability.
- Explore more advanced methods such as **ensemble learning** for better accuracy.
